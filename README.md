This is an exercise to predict customer churn with two Machine Learning models. It tests:

1.	Linear regression algorithm. Build a model in the BigQuery UI (BigQuery ML), and connect a BI tool (e.g., Looker, Qlik Sense, Power BI, etc.) to show the results.
    You will need to create your report with a BI tool on the BigQuery model.
2.	Linear regression model. This time Run iPython code from a Jupyter notebook instead and make charts in it.
3.	KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm in Python as well.

The demo uses the Telco Customer Churn from Kaggle:

You have all the code and the instructions to run the demo in the notebook Demo Customer Churn - BigQuery.ipynb.

There is a deck in this repository as well to help you during the demo.
